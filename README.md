# Tableau-crime-data-project

I've managed to produce some graphs in tableau. The desktop version doesn't have many output options, so pdf it is.

I like that the plots look clean with a good balance of white space. Perhaps I had too many datasources. Perhaps I just have to get used to using tableau.
